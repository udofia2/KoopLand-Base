i want to work work with real data now
i have created an idea and i want it to be stored in the data base and fetched and rendered on the marketplace, the ideas are created along with their pictures and weve already add cloudinary variables to the .env. 
when the ideas are clicked on and theyre directed to the  page of the idea  let them be provided with two buttons "pay with sideshift" or pay with "connected wallet"

if they choose to pay with sideshift, then use the integrated sideshift functionality to let them pay
the "connected wallet" button functionality for now isnt ready
